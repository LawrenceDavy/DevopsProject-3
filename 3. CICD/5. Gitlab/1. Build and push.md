Pipeline workflow
<br>
Commits should not be pushed directly to the main branch. When we add a feature or fix a bug, we should create branch from the main branch. Once the code is pushed to the branch the, pipeline checks to see if the Docker image can be built successfully. Other members of the team check the merge request and decide if it can be merged. Once the code is approved it is pushed to the main branch. The pipeline then begins to build the docker images, pushes them to Docker hub and helm deploys the code to the staging namespace.
<br>
When the final decision has been made the pipeline is manually executed to deploy the code to production and hosted on the default namespace.

Gitlab expects root directory written in yaml so it knows how to execute CI/CD tasks. 
<br>
The first pipeline will preform the build and push stages, It will build our Docker images and push them to Docker hub.

<hr>

It is not a good idea to push code directly to the main branch. We should create a branch from main, make changes in that branch and issue a merge request. After the code is reviewed and the merge request is ready to can be merged to main and the CI/CD pipeline kicks in to build and push images. Otherwise developers can push code that breaks the images.

Change settings in gitlab.

Make and switch to a new branch.

Edit the code in one of our web files and merge this change to the main branch by creating a merge request. 
<br>
Gitlab gives us a link that we can use to create a merge request.

<br>

The pipeline gets triggered when we make a merge request but we wont be able to merge the code unless the pipeline succeed.
When the pipeline is done and the code is merged, a new comment was made to the main branch when the feature branch was merged.
