We are going to see how we can choose which version will go to production and how gitlab will automatie the process. We are going to add two stages to our gitlab file, promote and deploy.

We have several commits to our application and now we have to select which version of the application will be deployed to production. By adding git tags to a commit it will easier to differenciate each commit.

Tag our initial version 1.0.0

Now that we have a tag in our git history we need to retag our Docker images to reflect this change. This is called code promotion. Where we select parts of code to be shipped to production.

To deploy code to production we need to add a stage for this. Since this a critical step this must be secured manually. Since it is at deployment stage we will use the helm image. We also specify the restriction ‘when manual’ which means the stage will only run when the user pushes a button to deploy to production.
