For this application we will use four helm charts, one for each of our microservices. The charts will contain three deployments and three services and secrets for storing the API key for the weather container. For MySQL we will be also using a helm chart for automatic deployment. Before we use Helm in a cluster we need to build and push our images to a repository that the cluster can connect to.

Login to Docker Hub.

<br>

Build the docker image from the auth folder and tag it with the Docker hub account and then push it.

Do the same for the UI image

Repeat for the weather image

Authentication Service<br>
Create authentication helm chart
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image8.png">
<br>

Edit the Chart.yaml file in the weatherapp-auth folder. Give the chart a better description and change the app version equal to the image tag we set in Docker hub.

<br>

To make sure the database is always created when the auth chart is deployed we need to add it as an dependency chart. 
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image10.png">
<br>

In the values.yaml file, change the replica count to 2 since we need two for each microservice. Change the image repository to our auth image. Change the service port to 8080.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image11.png">
<br>
<br>
<br>

Access the deployment.yaml file located in the templates folder. The auth service needs to know how to connect to the database. So we need to define two environment variables for the database, host and password.
<br>
Set DB_HOST as the environment variable name. Value is the name of the service that the MySQL helm chart will create. We can refer to the service of any dependent chart by using the release name followed by the name of our child chart which is MySQL.
<br>
The helm chart stores the DB_PASSWORD in a secret so donâ€™t need to create one but we need to refer to the secret when we need to use the password. Add the key the bitnami MySQL chart uses for storing the password.
<br>
We also need to the change the container port to 8080.
<br>

<br>

Since we are using MySQL as a dependent/child chart we need to pull it so it be used.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image13.png">
<br>

MySQL chart file can be found in the charts subdirectory
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image14.png">
<br>

To supply the database password, we need to pass it along the helm install command as a command line argument.
<br>
NOTE: Helm upgrade is a better option as we can make changes and apply them to our chart without changing commands.

Weather service
<br>
Create weather chart
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image17.png">
<br>

Edit the Chart.yaml file file and give it a better description and change the appVersion so it equal to the tag of the docker image.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image18.png">
<br>

The weather API service needs a API key to be able to connect to the open weather API service. The key needs to be stored in a secret for security reasons. We need to create a template for a secret.
<br>
We are not going to save the API key in the values file since this is bad practice. We are going to pass the API key the same way we passed the database password to the command line. We can store those values in the CI/CD pipeline later.
<br>
Create secret.yaml in template directory.
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image19.png">
<br>

In the values.yaml file, change the replica count to 2, give the proper image repository name and change the service port to 5000.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image20.png">
<br>

In the deployment.yaml file, we need to add our environment variable for the API key. The value will come from the secret we created. Change the container port to 5000.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image21.png">

UI service
<br>
Create UI chart.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image23.png">
<br>

Edit the Chart.yaml file file and give it a better description and change the appVersion so it equal to the tag of the docker image.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image24.png">
<br>

In the values.yaml file, change the replica count to 2 and give the proper image repository name. Change the service type to load balancer since we need external access to the microservice.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image25.png">
<br>

In the deployment.yaml add two environment variables. The names and endpoints of both authentication service and the weather service. Change the container port to 3000.
<img src="https://github.com/LawrenceDavy13/DevopsProject-3-Kubernetes/blob/main/images/4.%20CICD/2.%20Helm/image26.png">
